# Overview

NVIDIA NemoClaw is an open source reference stack that simplifies running [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) always-on assistants safely. It incorporates policy-based privacy and security guardrails, giving users control over their agents' behavior and data handling. This enables self-evolving claws to run more safely in clouds, on prem, RTX PCs, and DGX Spark.

NemoClaw uses open source models, such as [NVIDIA Nemotron](https://build.nvidia.com), alongside the [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) runtime, part of the NVIDIA Agent Toolkit, a secure environment designed for executing claws more safely. By combining open source models with built-in safety measures, NemoClaw simplifies and secures AI agent deployment.

| Capability              | Description                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sandbox OpenClaw        | Creates an OpenShell sandbox pre-configured for OpenClaw, with strict filesystem and network policies applied from the first boot.                   |
| Route inference         | Configures OpenShell inference routing so agent traffic flows through cloud-hosted Nemotron 3 Super 120B via [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com). |
| Manage the lifecycle    | Handles blueprint versioning, digest verification, and sandbox setup.                                                                                |

## Challenge

Autonomous AI agents like OpenClaw can make arbitrary network requests, access the host filesystem, and call any inference endpoint. Without guardrails, this creates security, cost, and compliance risks that grow as agents run unattended.

## Benefits

NemoClaw provides the following benefits.

| Benefit                    | Description                                                                                                            |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sandboxed execution        | Every agent runs inside an OpenShell sandbox with Landlock, seccomp, and network namespace isolation. No access is granted by default. |
| NVIDIA cloud inference     | Agent traffic routes through cloud-hosted Nemotron 3 Super 120B via [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com), transparent to the agent.          |
| Declarative network policy | Egress rules are defined in YAML. Unknown hosts are blocked and surfaced to the operator for approval.                 |
| Single CLI                 | The `nemoclaw` command orchestrates the full stack: gateway, sandbox, inference provider, and network policy.           |
| Blueprint lifecycle        | Versioned blueprints handle sandbox creation, digest verification, and reproducible setup.                             |

## Use Cases

You can use NemoClaw for various use cases including the following.

| Use Case                  | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Always-on assistant       | Run an OpenClaw assistant with controlled network access and operator-approved egress.        |
| Sandboxed testing         | Test agent behavior in a locked-down environment before granting broader permissions.         |
| Remote GPU deployment     | Deploy a sandboxed agent to a remote GPU instance for persistent operation.                   |
