# Sandbox Image Hardening

The NemoClaw sandbox image applies several security measures to reduce attack
surface and limit the blast radius of untrusted workloads.

## Removed Unnecessary Tools

Build toolchains (`gcc`, `g++`, `make`) and network probes (`netcat`) are
explicitly purged from the runtime image. These tools are not needed at runtime
and would unnecessarily widen the attack surface.

If you need a compiler during build, use the existing multi-stage build
(the `builder` stage has full Node.js tooling) and copy only artifacts into the
runtime stage.

## Process Limits

The container ENTRYPOINT sets `ulimit -u 512` to cap the number of processes
a sandbox user can spawn. This mitigates fork-bomb attacks. The startup script
(`nemoclaw-start.sh`) applies the same limit.

Adjust the value via the `--ulimit nproc=512:512` flag if launching with
`docker run` directly.

## Dropping Linux Capabilities

When running the sandbox container, drop all Linux capabilities and re-add only
what is strictly required:

```console
$ docker run --rm \
    --cap-drop=ALL \
    --ulimit nproc=512:512 \
    nemoclaw-sandbox
```

### Docker Compose Example

```yaml
services:
  nemoclaw-sandbox:
    image: nemoclaw-sandbox:latest
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
    ulimits:
      nproc:
        soft: 512
        hard: 512
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:size=64m
```

> **Note:** The `Dockerfile` itself cannot enforce `--cap-drop` — that is a
> runtime concern controlled by the container orchestrator. Always configure
> capability dropping in your `docker run` flags, Compose file, or Kubernetes
> `securityContext`.
