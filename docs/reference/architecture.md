# Architecture

NemoClaw has two main components: a TypeScript plugin that integrates with the OpenClaw CLI, and a Python blueprint that orchestrates OpenShell resources.

## System Overview

NVIDIA OpenShell is a general-purpose agent runtime. It provides sandbox containers, a credential-storing gateway, inference proxying, and policy enforcement, but has no opinions about what runs inside. NemoClaw is an opinionated reference stack built on OpenShell that handles what goes in the sandbox and makes the setup accessible.

## NemoClaw Plugin

The plugin is a thin TypeScript package that registers an inference provider and the `/nemoclaw` slash command.
It runs in-process with the OpenClaw gateway inside the sandbox.

```text

```

## NemoClaw Blueprint

The blueprint is a versioned Python artifact with its own release stream.
The plugin resolves, verifies, and executes the blueprint as a subprocess.
The blueprint drives all interactions with the OpenShell CLI.

```text
nemoclaw-blueprint/
├── blueprint.yaml                  Manifest — version, profiles, compatibility
├── policies/
│   └── openclaw-sandbox.yaml       Default network + filesystem policy
```

The blueprint runtime (TypeScript) lives in the plugin source tree:

```text
nemoclaw/src/blueprint/
├── runner.ts                       CLI runner — plan / apply / status / rollback
├── ssrf.ts                         SSRF endpoint validation (IP + DNS checks)
├── snapshot.ts                     Migration snapshot / restore lifecycle
├── state.ts                        Persistent run state management
```

### Blueprint Lifecycle

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A[resolve] --> B[verify digest]
    B --> C[plan]
    C --> D[apply]
    D --> E[status]
```

1. Resolve. The plugin locates the blueprint artifact and checks the version against `min_openshell_version` and `min_openclaw_version` constraints in `blueprint.yaml`.
2. Verify. The plugin checks the artifact digest against the expected value.
3. Plan. The runner determines what OpenShell resources to create or update, such as the gateway, providers, sandbox, inference route, and policy.
4. Apply. The runner executes the plan by calling `openshell` CLI commands.
5. Status. The runner reports current state.

## Sandbox Environment

The sandbox runs the
[`ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell-community/sandboxes/openclaw`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell-Community)
container image. Inside the sandbox:

- OpenClaw runs with the NemoClaw plugin pre-installed.
- Inference calls are routed through OpenShell to the configured provider.
- Network egress is restricted by the baseline policy in `openclaw-sandbox.yaml`.
- Filesystem access is confined to `/sandbox` and `/tmp` for read-write access, with system paths read-only.

## Inference Routing

Inference requests from the agent never leave the sandbox directly.
OpenShell intercepts them and routes to the configured provider:

```text
Agent (sandbox)  ──▶  OpenShell gateway  ──▶  NVIDIA Endpoint (build.nvidia.com)
```

Refer to [Inference Options](../inference/inference-options.md) for provider configuration details.

## Host-Side State and Config

NemoClaw keeps its operator-facing state on the host rather than inside the sandbox.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.nemoclaw/credentials.json` | Provider credentials saved during onboarding. |
| `~/.nemoclaw/sandboxes.json` | Registered sandbox metadata, including the default sandbox selection. |
| `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` | Host OpenClaw configuration that NemoClaw snapshots or restores during migration flows. |

The following environment variables configure optional services and local access.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot token for the Telegram bridge. |
| `ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` | Comma-separated list of Telegram chat IDs allowed to message the agent. |
| `CHAT_UI_URL` | URL for the optional chat UI endpoint. |
| `NEMOCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH` | Build-time-only toggle that disables gateway device pairing when set to `1` before the sandbox image is created. |

For normal setup and reconfiguration, prefer `nemoclaw onboard` over editing these files by hand.
Do not treat `NEMOCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH` as a runtime setting for an already-created sandbox.
