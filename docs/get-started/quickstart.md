# Quickstart

:::{admonition} Alpha software
NemoClaw is in alpha, available as an early preview since March 16, 2026.
APIs, configuration schemas, and runtime behavior are subject to breaking changes between releases.
Do not use this software in production environments.
File issues and feedback through the GitHub repository as the project continues to stabilize.
:::

Follow these steps to get started with NemoClaw and your first sandboxed OpenClaw agent.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, check the prerequisites to ensure you have the necessary software and hardware to run NemoClaw.

### Hardware

| Resource | Minimum        | Recommended      |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| CPU      | 4 vCPU         | 4+ vCPU          |
| RAM      | 8 GB           | 16 GB            |
| Disk     | 20 GB free     | 40 GB free       |

The sandbox image is approximately 2.4 GB compressed. During image push, the Docker daemon, k3s, and the OpenShell gateway run alongside the export pipeline, which buffers decompressed layers in memory. On machines with less than 8 GB of RAM, this combined usage can trigger the OOM killer. If you cannot add memory, configuring at least 8 GB of swap can work around the issue at the cost of slower performance.

### Software

| Dependency | Version                          |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Linux      | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later |
| Node.js    | 22.16 or later |
| npm        | 10 or later |
| Container runtime | Supported runtime installed and running |
| [OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) | Installed |

### Container Runtimes

| Platform | Supported runtimes | Notes |
|----------|--------------------|-------|
| Linux | Docker | Primary supported path. |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | Colima, Docker Desktop | Install Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`) and start the runtime before running the installer. |
| macOS (Intel) | Docker Desktop | Start the runtime before running the installer. |
| Windows WSL | Docker Desktop (WSL backend) | Supported target path. |
| DGX Spark | Docker | Use the standard installer and `nemoclaw onboard`. |

## Install NemoClaw and Onboard OpenClaw Agent

Download and run the installer script.
The script installs Node.js if it is not already present, then runs the guided onboard wizard to create a sandbox, configure inference, and apply security policies.

:::{note}
NemoClaw creates a fresh OpenClaw instance inside the sandbox during the onboarding process.
:::

```bash
curl -fsSL https://www.nvidia.com/nemoclaw.sh | bash
```

If you use nvm or fnm to manage Node.js, the installer may not update your current shell's PATH.
If `nemoclaw` is not found after install, run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.zshrc` for zsh) or open a new terminal.

:::{note}
The onboard flow builds the sandbox image with `NEMOCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH=1` so the dashboard is immediately usable during setup.
This is a build-time setting baked into the sandbox image, not a runtime knob.
If you export `NEMOCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH` after onboarding finishes, it has no effect on an existing sandbox.
:::

When the install completes, a summary confirms the running environment:

```text
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sandbox      my-assistant (Landlock + seccomp + netns)
Model        nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b (NVIDIA Endpoints)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Run:         nemoclaw my-assistant connect
Status:      nemoclaw my-assistant status
Logs:        nemoclaw my-assistant logs --follow
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

[INFO]  === Installation complete ===
```

## Chat with the Agent

Connect to the sandbox, then chat with the agent through the TUI or the CLI.

```bash
nemoclaw my-assistant connect
```

In the sandbox shell, open the OpenClaw terminal UI and start a chat:

```bash
openclaw tui
```

Alternatively, send a single message and print the response:

```bash
openclaw agent --agent main --local -m "hello" --session-id test
```

## Uninstall

To remove NemoClaw and all resources created during setup, run the uninstall script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/refs/heads/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

| Flag               | Effect                                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `--yes`            | Skip the confirmation prompt.                       |
| `--keep-openshell` | Leave the `openshell` binary installed.              |
| `--delete-models`  | Also remove NemoClaw-pulled Ollama models.           |

For troubleshooting installation or onboarding issues, see the [Troubleshooting guide](../reference/troubleshooting.md).

## Next Steps

- [Switch inference providers](../inference/switch-inference-providers.md) to use a different model or endpoint.
- [Approve or deny network requests](../network-policy/approve-network-requests.md) when the agent tries to reach external hosts.
- [Customize the network policy](../network-policy/customize-network-policy.md) to pre-approve trusted domains.
- [Deploy to a remote GPU instance](../deployment/deploy-to-remote-gpu.md) for always-on operation.
- [Monitor sandbox activity](../monitoring/monitor-sandbox-activity.md) through the OpenShell TUI.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues during installation or onboarding, refer to the [Troubleshooting guide](../reference/troubleshooting.md) for common error messages and resolution steps.
