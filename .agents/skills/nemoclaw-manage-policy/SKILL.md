# Nemoclaw Manage Policy

Review and approve blocked agent network requests in the TUI.

## Prerequisites

- A running NemoClaw sandbox.
- The OpenShell CLI on your `PATH`.
- A running NemoClaw sandbox for dynamic changes, or the NemoClaw source repository for static changes.

Review and act on network requests that the agent makes to endpoints not listed in the sandbox policy.
OpenShell intercepts these requests and presents them in the TUI for operator approval.

## Step 1: Open the TUI

Start the OpenShell terminal UI to monitor sandbox activity:

```console
$ openshell term
```

For a remote sandbox, pass the instance name:

```console
$ ssh my-gpu-box 'cd /home/ubuntu/nemoclaw && . .env && openshell term'
```

The TUI displays the sandbox state, active inference provider, and a live feed of network activity.

## Step 2: Trigger a Blocked Request

When the agent attempts to reach an endpoint that is not in the baseline policy, OpenShell blocks the connection and displays the request in the TUI.
The blocked request includes the following details:

- **Host and port** of the destination.
- **Binary** that initiated the request.
- **HTTP method** and path, if available.

## Step 3: Approve or Deny the Request

The TUI presents an approval prompt for each blocked request.

- **Approve** the request to add the endpoint to the running policy for the current session.
- **Deny** the request to keep the endpoint blocked.

Approved endpoints remain in the running policy until the sandbox stops.
They are not persisted to the baseline policy file.

## Step 4: Run the Walkthrough

To observe the approval flow in a guided session, run the walkthrough script:

```console
$ ./scripts/walkthrough.sh
```

This script opens a split tmux session with the TUI on the left and the agent on the right.
The walkthrough requires tmux and the `NVIDIA_API_KEY` environment variable.

Add, remove, or modify the endpoints that the sandbox is allowed to reach.

The sandbox policy is defined in a declarative YAML file in the NemoClaw repository and enforced at runtime by [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell).
NemoClaw supports both static policy changes that persist across restarts and dynamic updates applied to a running sandbox through the OpenShell CLI.

## Step 5: Static Changes

Static changes modify the baseline policy file and take effect after the next sandbox creation.

### Edit the Policy File

Open `nemoclaw-blueprint/policies/openclaw-sandbox.yaml` and add or modify endpoint entries.

Each entry in the `network` section defines an endpoint group with the following fields:

`endpoints`
: Host and port pairs that the sandbox can reach.

`binaries`
: Executables allowed to use this endpoint.

`rules`
: HTTP methods and paths that are permitted.

### Re-Run Onboard

Apply the updated policy by re-running the onboard wizard:

```console
$ nemoclaw onboard
```

The wizard picks up the modified policy file and applies it to the sandbox.

### Verify the Policy

Check that the sandbox is running with the updated policy:

```console
$ nemoclaw <name> status
```

## Step 6: Dynamic Changes

Dynamic changes apply a policy update to a running sandbox without restarting it.

### Create a Policy File

Create a YAML file with the endpoints to add.
Follow the same format as the baseline policy in `nemoclaw-blueprint/policies/openclaw-sandbox.yaml`.

### Apply the Policy

Use the OpenShell CLI to apply the policy update:

```console
$ openshell policy set <policy-file>
```

The change takes effect immediately.

### Scope of Dynamic Changes

Dynamic changes apply only to the current session.
When the sandbox stops, the running policy resets to the baseline defined in the policy file.
To make changes permanent, update the static policy file and re-run setup.

## Step 7: Policy Presets

NemoClaw ships preset policy files for common integrations in `nemoclaw-blueprint/policies/presets/`.
Apply a preset as-is or use it as a starting template for a custom policy.

Available presets:

| Preset | Endpoints |
|--------|-----------|
| `discord` | Discord webhook API |
| `docker` | Docker Hub, NVIDIA container registry |
| `huggingface` | Hugging Face model registry |
| `jira` | Atlassian Jira API |
| `npm` | npm and Yarn registries |
| `outlook` | Microsoft 365 and Outlook |
| `pypi` | Python Package Index |
| `slack` | Slack API and webhooks |
| `telegram` | Telegram Bot API |

To apply a preset to a running sandbox, pass it as a policy file:

```console
$ openshell policy set nemoclaw-blueprint/policies/presets/pypi.yaml
```

To include a preset in the baseline, merge its entries into `openclaw-sandbox.yaml` and re-run `nemoclaw onboard`.
