# Architecture

NemoClaw has two main components: a TypeScript plugin that integrates with the OpenClaw CLI, and a Python blueprint that orchestrates OpenShell resources.

## NemoClaw Plugin

The plugin is a thin TypeScript package that registers an inference provider and the `/nemoclaw` slash command.
It runs in-process with the OpenClaw gateway inside the sandbox.

```

## NemoClaw Blueprint

The blueprint is a versioned Python artifact with its own release stream.
The plugin resolves, verifies, and executes the blueprint as a subprocess.
The blueprint drives all interactions with the OpenShell CLI.

```text
nemoclaw-blueprint/
├── blueprint.yaml                  Manifest — version, profiles, compatibility
├── policies/
│   └── openclaw-sandbox.yaml       Default network + filesystem policy
```

The blueprint runtime (TypeScript) lives in the plugin source tree:

```text
nemoclaw/src/blueprint/
├── runner.ts                       CLI runner — plan / apply / status / rollback
├── ssrf.ts                         SSRF endpoint validation (IP + DNS checks)
├── snapshot.ts                     Migration snapshot / restore lifecycle
├── state.ts                        Persistent run state management
```

### Blueprint Lifecycle

    A[resolve] --> B[verify digest]

    C --> D[apply]
    D --> E[status]
```

1. Resolve. The plugin locates the blueprint artifact and checks the version against `min_openshell_version` and `min_openclaw_version` constraints in `blueprint.yaml`.
2. Verify. The plugin checks the artifact digest against the expected value.
3. Plan. The runner determines what OpenShell resources to create or update, such as the gateway, providers, sandbox, inference route, and policy.
4. Apply. The runner executes the plan by calling `openshell` CLI commands.
5. Status. The runner reports current state.

## Sandbox Environment

The sandbox runs the
[`ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell-community/sandboxes/openclaw`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell-Community)
container image. Inside the sandbox:

- OpenClaw runs with the NemoClaw plugin pre-installed.
- Inference calls are routed through OpenShell to the configured provider.
- Network egress is restricted by the baseline policy in `openclaw-sandbox.yaml`.
- Filesystem access is confined to `/sandbox` and `/tmp` for read-write access, with system paths read-only.

## Inference Routing

Inference requests from the agent never leave the sandbox directly.
OpenShell intercepts them and routes to the configured provider:

```text
Agent (sandbox)  ──▶  OpenShell gateway  ──▶  NVIDIA Endpoint (build.nvidia.com)
```

Refer to Inference Profiles (see the `nemoclaw-reference` skill) for provider configuration details.
