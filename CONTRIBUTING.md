# Contributing to NVIDIA NemoClaw

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NVIDIA NemoClaw. This guide covers how to set up your development environment, run tests, and submit changes.

## Before You Open an Issue

- A real bug that you confirmed and could not fix.
- A feature proposal with a design — not a "please build this" request.
- Security vulnerabilities must follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — **not** GitHub issues.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and npm 10+
- Python 3.11+ (for blueprint and documentation builds)
- Docker (running)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for Python dependency management)

## Getting Started

Install the root dependencies and build the TypeScript plugin:

```bash
# Install root dependencies (OpenClaw + CLI entry point)
npm install

# Install and build the TypeScript plugin
cd nemoclaw && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Install Python deps for the blueprint
cd nemoclaw-blueprint && uv sync && cd ..
```

## Building

The TypeScript plugin lives in `nemoclaw/` and compiles with `tsc`:

```bash
cd nemoclaw
npm run build        # one-time compile
npm run dev          # watch mode
```

## Main Tasks

These are the primary `make` and `npm` targets for day-to-day development:

| Task | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `make check` | Run all linters (TypeScript + Python) |
| `make lint` | Same as `make check` |
| `make format` | Auto-format TypeScript and Python source |
| `npm test` | Run root-level tests (`test/*.test.js`) |
| `cd nemoclaw && npm test` | Run plugin unit tests (Vitest) |
| `make docs` | Build documentation (Sphinx/MyST) |
| `make docs-live` | Serve docs locally with auto-rebuild |

## Project Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `nemoclaw/` | TypeScript plugin (Commander CLI, OpenClaw extension) |
| `nemoclaw-blueprint/` | Python blueprint for sandbox orchestration |
| `bin/` | CLI entry point (`nemoclaw.js`) |
| `scripts/` | Install helpers and automation scripts |
| `test/` | Root-level integration tests |
| `docs/` | User-facing documentation (Sphinx/MyST) |

## Documentation

If your change affects user-facing behavior (new commands, changed defaults, new features, bug fixes that contradict existing docs), update the relevant pages under `docs/` in the same PR.

If you use an AI coding agent (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc.), the repo includes the `/update-docs` skill that drafts doc updates. Use them before writing from scratch and follow the style guide in [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

To build and preview docs locally:

```bash
make docs       # build the docs
make docs-live  # serve locally with auto-rebuild
```

See [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full style guide and writing conventions.

## Pull Requests

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes with tests.
3. Run `make check` and `npm test` to verify.
4. Open a PR.

### Commit Messages

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). All commit messages must follow the format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build config)
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `ci` - CI/CD changes
- `perf` - Performance improvements

**Examples:**

```
feat(cli): add --profile flag to nemoclaw onboard
fix(blueprint): handle missing API key gracefully
docs: update quickstart for new install wizard
chore(deps): bump commander to 13.2
```
